    "例如，sllm.chat([input_msg]) 期望一个 ChatMessage 列表，直接传入字符串会导致错误。\n",
    "支持多轮对话：\n",
    "ChatMessage 支持多轮对话场景，通过列表 [msg1, msg2, ...] 传递对话历史。例如：\n",
    "\n",
    "messages = [\n",

The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers,\\nsmall and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its\\ndirect sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network\\ncarriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2021, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution\\nchannels accounted for 36% and 64%, respectively, of total net sales.\\nCompetition\\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price\\ncompetition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short\\nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid\\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of\\nthe Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating\\nthe Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative\\nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\\nits products, including the hardware,  operating system,  numerous      software applications and related services. Principal\\ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative\\nprice and  performance, product  and  service quality and reliability,  design innovation, a strong third-party software and\\naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\\n                                                Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 2', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have\\nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings\\nwith large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products\\nand a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut\\nprices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products\\nat little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for\\nfree and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition\\nas competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated\\nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\\nSupply of Components\\nAlthough  most  components   essential to  the Company’s   business  are  generally available from  multiple sources, certain\\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with\\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many\\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by\\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to\\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the\\nCompany will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in\\nAsia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\\nResearch and Development\\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s\\nability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products,\\nservices and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing\\nproducts and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of\\nintellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\\nIntellectual Property\\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices,\\naccessories, software and services. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of\\nintellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such\\nintellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the\\nCompany relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\\nThe Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is\\ncurrently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio\\nof issued patents, including utility patents, design patents and others. The Company also holds copyrights relating to certain\\naspects of its products and services. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s\\nproducts. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its\\nproducts.\\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include\\nintellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various\\naspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such\\nlicenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future\\non reasonable terms or at all.\\n                                                 Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 3', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of\\nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect\\ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an\\nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and\\ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nHuman Capital\\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated, and dedicated team, and is committed to supporting the development of all\\nof its team members and to continuously building on its strong culture. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had\\napproximately 154,000 full-time equivalent employees.\\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\\nThe Company is committed to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex,\\nsexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, veteran status, caste or other legally protected characteristic. The\\nCompany is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity.\\nCompensation and Benefits\\nThe Company believes that compensation should not only be competitive; it should be equitable and should enable employees\\nto share in the Company’s success as shareholders of the Company. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to\\nthrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal\\nlives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits to employees around the world.\\nGrowth and Development\\nThe Company invests in tools and resources that support employees’ individual growth and development.

The Company also offers team\\nmembers access to ongoing inclusion and diversity education, and support throughout their career journey and helps them find\\ncommunity and connection through employee groups that create spaces for belonging, learning, and growing inclusivity, diversity\\nand equity efforts.\\nEngagement\\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leadership fosters an open,\\ncollaborative work environment where everyone can participate, develop and thrive. Team members are encouraged to come to\\ntheir managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company regularly conducts surveys that gauge employee\\nsentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\\nHealth and Safety\\nThe Company    is committed  to protecting its employees  everywhere  it operates. The Company    identifies potential risks\\nassociated with workplace activities in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports\\nemployees with general safety training and puts specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard\\nenvironments,  including chemical  management,    laser safety,  equipment  and   machinery  safety, hazardous   materials\\nmanagement and electrical safety. The Company has taken additional measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, including\\nproviding information resources, testing, face masks and personal protective equipment, and case support. The Company also\\noffers special sick leave for employees with possible COVID-19 symptoms, as well as comprehensive health coverage.\\n                                                Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 4', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations,\\ntemporary  closures of businesses,  and  quarantine  and  shelter-in-place orders. The  COVID-19   pandemic   has at  times\\nsignificantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the\\nfuture materially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of\\nthe Company’s stock. During the course of the pandemic, certain of the Company’s component suppliers and manufacturing and\\nlogistical service providers have experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide, and similar\\ndisruptions could occur in the future. The Company’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, have been\\ntemporarily closed at various times. In many cases, as stores and points of sale have reopened, they are subject to operating\\nrestrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers. The Company has at times required\\nsubstantially all of its employees to work remotely.\\nThe Company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and\\nrequirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company’s operational and\\nfinancial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing,\\nextent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and\\neffectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on\\nthe global economy and demand for consumer products. Additional future impacts on the Company may include, but are not\\nlimited to, material adverse effects on demand for the Company’s products and services, the Company’s supply chain and sales\\nand distribution channels, the Company’s ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company’s profitability and cost structure.\\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and\\nstock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and\\nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\\ncondition.\\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales.\\nIn addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including\\nmanufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend\\nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions.\\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to\\ntrade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations\\ncan materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services.

These and other economic\\nfactors can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism,\\nnatural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents\\nand other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material\\nadverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular\\nnetwork carriers and other channel partners.\\nThe Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international\\ntrade. Trade and other international disputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that restrict international trade\\nand can adversely affect the Company’s business. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of\\ntariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost\\nof the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely\\nimpact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive\\nfor customers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also\\nadopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the\\nCompany’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services as designed. These\\nmeasures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships,\\nand ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or\\nchanged trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to\\nmanagement. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to\\neffectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international\\ndisputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s\\nbusiness.\\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract\\nmanufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and\\nfacilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial\\naccidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health\\nissues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate\\nchange is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can\\nmake it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and\\ninefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service\\nofferings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant\\nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales.

The Company    has also  outsourced much   of its transportation and logistics management.

Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to\\nindustry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s\\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high\\ndemand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could materially adversely affect, the Company’s ability to\\nobtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has\\nentered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or\\nrenew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can\\nlead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain\\nsufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic\\nconditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on\\nglobal and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s\\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition,” above, can also affect the Company’s ability to obtain components.\\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially\\nadversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source.

When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has\\nbeen delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the\\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints\\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as\\ninternationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be\\nexpensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these\\nconsiderations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges.\\nThere can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These\\nagreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to\\nchange its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services.\\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form\\n10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading\\n“Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a\\nmaterial loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other\\nclaims.\\n                                                Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 13', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs,\\nlimiting the Company’s ability to offer a product or service to customers, requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and\\nbusiness practices or otherwise making the Company’s products and services less attractive to customers. The Company has\\nimplemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no\\nassurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies\\nand procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the\\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may\\nnot be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures.\\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory\\nscrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market\\nand legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the\\nproposed EU Digital Markets Act, could, if enacted, require further changes. These changes could include how and to what\\nextent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.\\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in\\nlegal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact\\non the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of\\ninvestigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse\\nfindings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its\\nApp Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\\ncondition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s\\nbusiness practices, and may in the future result in further changes.\\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become\\nsubject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could adversely affect the Company’s\\ncommercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of\\noperations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies\\nto offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and apps, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to\\ngovernment investigations and legal proceedings.\\nThere can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by\\nthe outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.

Several jurisdictions have passed laws\\nin this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These\\nlaws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing\\nrequirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to\\nchange its business practices.

For example,\\nthe gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross\\nmargins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global\\nproduct pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased\\ncompetition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product\\nlife cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and\\ndelivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively;\\nshifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory\\nchanges require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the\\nintroduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors\\ncould have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in\\npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of\\nsales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a\\ndecline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales.

The Company also\\nhas unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors\\nthat manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments\\nassociated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 25, 2021, the\\nCompany’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a\\nfew individual vendors located primarily in Asia.

The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global\\neconomic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the\\nmeasures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business,\\nresults of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock.\\nDuring 2021, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the\\nCompany’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and a significant number\\nof the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened all of its retail stores and substantially all of its other\\nfacilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it\\ncontinues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations. During the fourth\\nquarter of 2021, certain of the Company’s component suppliers and logistical service providers experienced disruptions, resulting\\nin supply shortages that affected sales worldwide. Similar disruptions could occur in the future.\\nThe extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is\\nuncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of\\nthe pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and\\ntreatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and\\ndemand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” for more information.\\nFiscal 2021 Highlights\\nTotal net sales increased 33% or $91.3 billion during 2021 compared to 2020, driven by growth in all Products and Services\\ncategories. Year-over-year net sales during 2021 also grew in each of the Company’s reportable segments.\\nIn April 2021, the Company announced an increase to its current share repurchase program authorization from $225 billion to\\n$315 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.205 to $0.22 per share beginning in May 2021.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone\\nbasis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the\\nCompany’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions\\nwill offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates.\\nFurther, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses\\nrelated to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and\\noperating results.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nThe Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and outstanding\\ndebt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company’s interest income and expense are most\\nsensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash,\\ncash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and\\ninterest paid on the Company’s debt.\\nThe Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s liquidity\\nrequirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and\\nachieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of\\nminimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment\\ngrade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk\\nassociated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a\\nchange in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield\\ncurve. Based on investment positions as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, a hypothetical 100 basis point\\nincrease in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.1 billion and $3.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market\\nvalue of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\\nAs of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying\\nmaturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $118.7 billion and $107.4 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in\\nthe future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow\\nthe Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate\\npayments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging\\ninstrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of\\nSeptember 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 to increase by $186 million and $218 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\\nForeign Currency Risk\\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and\\nin particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in\\nU.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there\\nhas been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign\\nexchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future\\ncash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into\\nforeign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated\\ndebt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue\\nand inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign\\nexchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic\\ncost of hedging particular exposures.\\n                                                 Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 26', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random\\nmarket price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given\\nconfidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model\\nis not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm\\ncommitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model.

Intercompany accounts  and  transactions have been  eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s\\nmanagement, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary\\nfor fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in\\nconformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\\naffect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the\\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying  notes have  been  reclassified to conform to the current period’s\\npresentation.\\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The\\nCompany’s fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years,\\nquarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and\\nperiods of those fiscal years.\\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses\\nAt the beginning of the first quarter of 2021, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”)\\nAccounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit\\nLosses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain\\nfinancial instruments. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. The adoption of\\nASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.\\nAdvertising Costs\\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\\nShare-Based Compensation\\nThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on\\nthe date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest.\\nFurther information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”\\nEarnings Per Share\\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (net income in\\nmillions and shares in thousands):\\n                                                                           2021           2020            2019\\n Numerator:\\n     Net income                                                       $        94,680  $          57,411  $   55,256\\n Denominator:\\n     Weighted-average basic shares outstanding                             16,701,272         17,352,119  18,471,336\\n     Effect of dilutive securities                                            163,647            176,095     124,315\\n     Weighted-average diluted shares                                       16,864,919         17,528,214  18,595,651\\n Basic earnings per share                                             $          5.67  $            3.31  $     2.99\\n Diluted earnings per share                                           $          5.61  $            3.28  $     2.97\\n                                             Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 34', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The\\nCompany classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying\\ncontractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale are\\nrecognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).\\nThe Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and their\\navailability for use in current operations.

Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the\\nestimated useful lives of the assets, which range from five to seven years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property\\nand equipment was $9.5 billion, $9.7 billion and $11.3 billion during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\\nNoncash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net decrease to accounts payable and other\\ncurrent liabilities of $2.9 billion during 2019.\\nRestricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities\\nThe Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The\\nCompany reports restricted cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current or non-current\\nclassification based on the expected duration of the restriction. The Company reports restricted marketable securities as current\\nor non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities.\\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\\nAll derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative\\ngains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation.\\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred\\nin accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged\\ntransaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For options designated as\\ncash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it on a\\nstraight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates.\\nChanges in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.\\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in\\nthe Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to\\nthe change in value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company\\nexcludes the forward carry component from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it in OI&E on a straight-line\\nbasis over the life of the hedge.

The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments\\nand all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market\\nprices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\\nNote 2 – Revenue Recognition\\nNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue\\nat the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is\\ngenerally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of\\nownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control\\ntransfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are\\ndelivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or\\ncommencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer\\nincentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the\\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”).\\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are\\nestablished that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they\\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation\\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,\\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\\nThe Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone,\\nMac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated\\nsales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to\\nreceive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the\\nright to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with\\neach device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative\\nSSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is\\nbased on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized\\nwhen control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the\\nproduct-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis\\nover the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software,\\nincluding estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled\\nservices and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred.\\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For\\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that\\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized\\nrevenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the\\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when\\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of\\nthe product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For\\nthird-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content\\nstores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer.

In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit\\ninsurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-\\nfinancing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company\\ngenerally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\\nAs of both September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or\\nmore of total trade receivables.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the\\nCompany for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated\\nthe application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of\\n€1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the\\nEuropean Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25,\\n2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company\\nbelieves that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable\\nagainst U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.\\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for\\ncertain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 25, 2021, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.7 billion, excluding\\ninterest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use\\npending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal\\noptions, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. The Company’s lease arrangements may contain both lease and\\nnonlease components. The Company has elected to combine and account for lease and nonlease components as a single lease\\ncomponent for leases of retail, corporate, and data center facilities.\\nPayments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based\\non purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating\\nleases were $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the\\nCompany’s leases were $12.9 billion and $9.3 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Rent expense for operating leases, as\\npreviously reported under former lease accounting standards, was $1.3 billion in 2019.\\nThe Company made $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases in 2021 and 2020,\\nrespectively. Noncash activities involving right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $3.3 billion\\nfor 2021 and $10.5 billion for 2020, including the impact of adopting FASB ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in the first\\nquarter of 2020.\\nThe  following table shows ROU    assets  and  lease liabilities, and the associated financial statement line items, as of\\nSeptember 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (in millions):\\n Lease-Related Assets and Liabilities       Financial Statement Line Items                   2021             2020\\n Right-of-use assets:\\n     Operating leases                       Other non-current assets                    $         10,087  $        8,570\\n     Finance leases                         Property, plant and equipment, net                       861            629\\n          Total right-of-use assets                                                     $         10,948  $        9,199\\n Lease liabilities:\\n     Operating leases                       Other current liabilities                   $          1,449  $        1,436\\n                                            Other non-current liabilities                          9,506           7,745\\n     Finance leases                         Other current liabilities                                 79              24\\n                                            Other non-current liabilities                            769             637\\n          Total lease liabilities                                                       $         11,803  $        9,842\\n                                                Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 43', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan\\ngenerally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s\\ncommon stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under\\nthe plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding\\nobligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of\\nRSUs canceled or shares withheld. All RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which\\nentitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting\\nand other terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. As of September 25, 2021, approximately 760 million shares were\\nreserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan\\nthat expire, are canceled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for RSUs, will also be\\navailable for awards under the 2014 Plan.\\nApple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan\\nThe Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i) permits the\\nCompany to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial\\ngrants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each\\nannual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of\\nstock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the\\nCompany’s common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further\\nshareholder approval. RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a\\nfactor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the\\nDirector Plan are entitled to DERs, which are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying\\nRSUs. As of September 25, 2021, approximately 4 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan.\\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\\nDuring the three months ended September 25, 2021, Section 16 officers Katherine L.

Therefore, many\\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by\\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\\nincreased.

On February 28, 2020, the\\nparties in the Multidistrict Litigation reached a settlement to resolve the U.S. federal and California state class actions. On March\\n18, 2021, the Northern California District Court granted final approval of the Multidistrict Litigation settlement, which will result in\\nan aggregate payment of $310 million to settle all claims. The Company continues to believe that its iPhones were not defective,\\nthat the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve\\ncustomers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material\\ninformation.\\nFrench Competition Authority\\nOn March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its decision that aspects of the Company’s sales and\\ndistribution practices in France violate French competition law, and issued a fine of €1.1 billion.

The Company’s reportable segments consist of the\\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe\\nincludes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong\\nand Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable\\nsegments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is\\nmanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market\\ndynamics of each geographic region.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial\\nreporting based on our audit.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and\\nprocedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\\nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to\\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts\\nand expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nOctober 28, 2021\\n                                                Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 54', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Controls and Procedures\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal\\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined\\nin Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 25, 2021 to provide reasonable\\nassurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is\\n(i) recorded, processed, summarized    and  reported within the time  periods specified in the SEC   rules and  forms           and\\n(ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal\\nfinancial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\\naccounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\\nthat:\\n        (i)    pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\\n               dispositions of the Company’s assets;\\n        (ii)            provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\\n                        statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in\\n               accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\\n        (iii)            provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\\n               disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s\\ninternal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can\\nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a\\ncontrol system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative\\nto their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute\\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of\\ncontrols in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in\\nbusiness conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the\\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework\\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s\\nassessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 25, 2021\\nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in\\naccordance with GAAP.
